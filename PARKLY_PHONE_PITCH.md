# Parkly Phone Pitch Scripts

## Template 1: 30-Second Elevator Pitch (Opening)

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Parkly. Have you ever paid $40 for parking at a 49ers game or spent 20 minutes circling for a spot? We've built a platform that connects drivers with nearby driveways—so you save money and time, while homeowners earn extra income. It's a win-win. Do you have 2 minutes to hear more?"

## Template 2: Full Phone Pitch (2-3 Minutes)

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] calling from Parkly. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. Do you have a couple minutes?"

[If yes, continue. If no, ask for a better time]

**The Hook:**
"Have you ever been frustrated by expensive parking or empty driveways in your neighborhood? We've created a solution that addresses both problems."

**The Problem:**
"Here's what we noticed: Going to events like 49ers games means dealing with hours of traffic, then paying $30-50 for parking that's still a long walk away. Meanwhile, there are thousands of empty driveways just sitting there unused."

**The Solution:**
"Parkly is a two-way platform—think Airbnb for parking. Property owners can list their driveways or parking lots, and drivers can find affordable, convenient parking nearby. Renters save money and time, rentees earn passive income. Everyone wins."

**The Story (Brief):**
"My co-founders and I grew up 15 minutes from Levi's Stadium. We were huge 49ers fans, but going to games was always a hassle—traffic, expensive parking, long walks. We saw those empty driveways and thought: there has to be a better way. That's how Parkly was born."

**The Ask:**
"[I'd love to show you how it works/I'm reaching out because I think this could benefit you/We're looking for early adopters]. Would you be interested in [a quick demo/learning more/joining our beta]?"

**Closing:**
"Great! [Set up next steps]. You can also reach me at team@useparkly.com or (408) 659-6839. Thanks for your time!"

## Template 3: Property Owner Pitch (Rentees)

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Parkly. Quick question: Do you have a driveway or parking space that sits empty during the day or on weekends?"

[Wait for response]

**The Pitch:**
"What if I told you that space could be earning you passive income? Parkly connects property owners like you with drivers looking for affordable parking. You list your space, set your availability, and drivers book through our app. You control when it's available, and you earn money with minimal effort."

**Address Concerns:**
"I know you might be thinking about security or hassle. We handle all payments securely, and you can block out times when you need the space. It's completely flexible."

**The Ask:**
"We're currently onboarding property owners in [your area]. Would you be interested in learning more or seeing how it works?"

## Template 4: Driver/User Pitch (Renters)

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Parkly. Quick question: How much did you pay for parking the last time you went to [local venue/event]?"

[Wait for response - likely $20-50]

**The Pitch:**
"What if you could pay half that and park closer? Parkly connects you with nearby driveways and parking spaces. Instead of paying $40 at a lot and walking 10 minutes, you could pay $15 and park right around the corner."

**The Benefits:**
"You save money, save time, and get better parking. Plus, you're supporting local property owners who are earning extra income. It's a win-win."

**The Ask:**
"We're launching soon and offering early access. Would you be interested in joining our waitlist? I can send you the link right now."

"[Their company] [does X], and we've noticed that [relevant connection to parking/events/customers]. We think there's a natural fit here."

"Parkly is a two-way parking platform that connects drivers with available parking spaces. We're [launching/expanding] and looking for strategic partners who can help us reach [relevant audience]."

**The Value Proposition:**

**The Ask:**

## Template 6: Investor Pitch (Phone)

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name], co-founder of Parkly. [Mutual connection] suggested I reach out. Do you have a few minutes?"

**The Hook:**
"We're disrupting the parking industry with a peer-to-peer marketplace. Think Airbnb, but for parking spaces."

**The Market:**
"The parking industry is worth [XX] billion, but it's incredibly inefficient. Drivers overpay, while millions of spaces sit unused daily. We're solving both sides of that equation."

**The Solution:**
"Parkly is a two-way platform: property owners list their driveways, drivers find affordable parking. We take a small transaction fee. It's a proven model in the sharing economy."

**Traction/Progress:**
"We've [built the platform/launched beta/have X users/signed X property owners]. We're now [raising capital/expanding to new markets/scaling]."

**The Ask:**
"I'd love to share our pitch deck and discuss the opportunity. Would you be open to a 20-minute call this week?"

## Phone Pitch Best Practices:

### Before the Call:
1. **Research:** Know who you're calling and why
2. **Prepare:** Have your key points written down
3. **Time:** Choose a good time (avoid Monday mornings, Friday afternoons)
4. **Environment:** Find a quiet place with good reception

### During the Call:
1. **Be Enthusiastic:** Your energy is contagious
2. **Listen:** Pay attention to their responses and adjust
3. **Pause:** Give them time to respond, don't rush
4. **Ask Questions:** Engage them in conversation
5. **Handle Objections:** Be prepared for common concerns:
   - "I'm not interested" → "I understand. What would make you interested?"
   - "I'm too busy" → "I respect that. Can I send you a quick email instead?"
   - "How does this work?" → Have a clear, simple explanation ready

### Common Objections & Responses:

**"I don't need extra income"**
→ "That's fair. But it's completely passive—you set it and forget it. Even $50-100 a month adds up."

**"I'm worried about security"**
→ "I totally understand. We handle all payments securely, and you can see who's booking. Plus, you can block out times when you need the space."

**"I'm not sure about strangers using my driveway"**
→ "That's a valid concern. We verify all users, and you can see reviews and ratings. Many of our property owners have had great experiences."

**"This sounds complicated"**
→ "Actually, it's really simple. You list your space once, set your availability, and that's it. The app handles everything else."

### After the Call:
1. **Follow Up:** Send a thank-you email within 24 hours
2. **Next Steps:** Clearly outline what happens next
3. **Add Value:** Share relevant resources or information
4. **Track:** Keep notes on what worked and what didn't

### Closing Phrases:
- "Does that make sense?"
- "What questions do you have?"
- "What would be the next step?"
- "When would be a good time to follow up?"
- "I'll send you [X] and we can talk again [timeframe]."
