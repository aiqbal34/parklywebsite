## Template 1: General Outreach (Cold Email)

**Subject:** Turn Your Driveway Into Income with Parkly

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out from Parkly, a two-way parking platform that's revolutionizing how people find and offer parking spaces.

**The Problem:** Finding affordable parking near popular venues like Levi's Stadium, concert halls, or downtown areas is a constant struggle. Drivers face expensive lots, long walks, and traffic headaches. Meanwhile, homeowners and businesses with unused driveways or parking lots are missing out on easy income.

**The Solution:** Parkly connects drivers with nearby available parking spaces. Renters find cheaper, more convenient parking, while rentees earn passive income from their unused spaces. It's a win-win platform.

**Why Parkly?**
- **For Renters:** Save money and time with convenient, affordable parking options
- **For Rentees:** Monetize your driveway or parking lot with minimal effort
- **For Everyone:** Reduce traffic congestion and make better use of existing infrastructure

We're currently [launching/expanding] and would love to [discuss partnership opportunities/show you how it works/explore collaboration].

Would you be available for a quick 15-minute call this week? I'd be happy to show you how Parkly can benefit [your organization/your community/you].

Best regards,

## Template 2: Partnership/Investor Outreach

**Subject:** Parkly: Disrupting the $XX Billion Parking Industry

Hi [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm [Your Name], co-founder of Parkly, and I'd like to introduce you to an opportunity in the parking industry.

**The Market Opportunity:**
The parking industry is worth [XX] billion, yet it's plagued by inefficiencies. Drivers overpay for parking, while millions of parking spaces sit unused daily. Parkly addresses this by creating a peer-to-peer marketplace for parking.

**What We Do:**
Parkly is a two-way platform that:
- Allows homeowners and businesses to list their driveways/parking lots
- Enables drivers to find affordable, convenient parking near their destination
- Creates a seamless experience for both parties

**Our Story:**
Growing up 15 minutes from Levi's Stadium, my co-founders and I experienced firsthand the frustration of expensive parking and traffic. We noticed empty driveways in nearby neighborhoods and realized there had to be a better way—one that benefits both drivers and property owners.

**Why Now:**
- Increasing urbanization and event attendance
- Rising parking costs
- Growing acceptance of sharing economy platforms
- Technology that makes peer-to-peer transactions seamless

We're [raising capital/expanding to new markets/seeking strategic partners] and would value your insights and potential collaboration.

Would you be open to a brief conversation? I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,
